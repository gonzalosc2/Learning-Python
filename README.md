# Learning-Python

### author: Gonzalo Salazar

This repository has been created to document my progress learning Python (>=3.6). It can be separated in three main sources until December 2020.

1. _Computer Science I at Boston College_, Chestnut Hill, USA. Please check the syllabus [right here](https://github.com/gonzalosc2/Learning-Python/blob/master/CS1_BostonCollege/CS1.Syllabus-Fall2020.pdf).
2. _Udemy - 2020 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python_. Please check the syllabyus [right here](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/).
3. _Udemy - Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp_. Please check the syllabus [right here](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/).

I have learned for other sources as well, but I preferred to focus on those that have given me the most joy when coding (...more challenging and interesting). 

Note that this repository also contains material related to machine learning and data science. Since I would prefer to learn that using Python, I will be concentrating that content here as well. 

__This repository does not contain any major coding project.__ Minor projects can be found as problem sets or homework assignments. _To check the major ones, [click here](https://github.com/gonzalosc2/Coding-Projects)._

Enjoy the content and if you have any suggestion, please let me know.

Best,
g.
