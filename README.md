# Learning-Python

__author: Gonzalo Salazar__

This repository has been created to document my progress learning Python (>=3.6). It can be separeted in three main sources until December 2020.

1. Computer Science I at Boston College, Chestnut Hill, USA. Please check the syllabus [right here](https://github.com/gonzalosc2/Learning-Python/blob/master/CS1_BostonCollege/CS1.Syllabus-Fall2020.pdf).
2. Udemy - 2020 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python. Please check the syllabyus [right here](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/).
3. Udemy - Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp. Please check the syllabus [right here](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/).

I have learned for other sources as well, but I preferred to focus on those that have given me the most joy when coding (...more challenging and interesting). 

Note that this repository also contains material related to machine learning and data science. Since I would prefer to learn that using Python, I will be concentrating that content here as well. 

__This repository does not contain any major coding project.__ Minor projects can be found as problem sets or homework assignments. To check the major ones, [check here](https://github.com/gonzalosc2/Coding-Projects).

Enjoy the content and if you have any suggestion, please let me know.

Best,
g.
